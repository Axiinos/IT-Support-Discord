This is a small step guide how to get the bot running!

1. go to your discord bot webpage, and grab the token from there.

2. open system environment variables and add a new variable name "DISCORD_TOKEN" to the OS environment.

3. paste the discord token into the variable, this way, you keep your system sanitized from exposing your bot token.
its important not to share sensitive data, especially in code repo's!
